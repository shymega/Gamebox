Steam-ToyBox
============

# Overview

(Steam-)ToyBox is a Steam Play Compatibility Tool, Rust-based, and extendable.

ToyBox is inspired by SteamTinkerLaunch, but with a more extendable approach via
an embedded scripting language, modern UI (Iced), and written in an safe
language, with Flatpak support.

# Status

Currently, I'm working on reading up on Steam Play, creating the integration
between the embedded scripting language and the core library, as well as making
sure the Flatpak is created correctly.

# License

ToyBox is licensed under the GPL-3.0 (or later).
